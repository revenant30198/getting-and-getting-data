## About the source data
The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## About R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" performs the 5 following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work):   
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Only all the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set were kept.

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation

### The data were averaged based on subject and activity group.

Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30.
Activity column has 6 types as listed below.
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING
